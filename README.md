Best_Quotes
===========

Also part of Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs, this is a sample app of quotes designed to be used with a custom framework called "Rulers". It behaves much like a barebones Rails app, with a MVC structure and actual little SQLite3 database full of JSON objects (which are the actual quotes for the controller to render). Muuuuch more respect for how fully featured and robust Rails is after making this for myself.
